# skillnest

Skillnest is a mobile platform that uses a real-time database to allow students to browse local courses and connect with skilled teachers. Skillnest also sets up a space where teachers can display concise information about their background, their philosophy, and their course offerings in order to market themselves more effectively. Technologies used include React Native, ECMS 6, and Firebase.

##Inspiration

Have you ever wanted to learn an instrument, a language, or maybe a new sport?
Have you been interested in wine-making, surfing, or cooking classes?
Have you had difficulty figuring out where to start, what path to take or just wanted to find an amazing teacher in your area?  

Maybe you haven't had the time to sift through craigslist, or maybe you have and you found someone who wasn’t a great match.

Here’s the bottom line: People want to learn things and many do not know where to start.  They want a personal, transformative experience, but do not know how to go about finding it.

The solution is SkillNest and we are creating the Yelp of personal teaching.  This is a multi-billion dollar industry that has largely gone unnoticed because of its cash payment roots. 

##Technology

The full tech stack for our application includes React Native, Javascript ECMS 6 and Firebase.
